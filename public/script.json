  "script": "Hi, my name is _____, I’m a constituent and I’m calling to ask my Council Member to repeal the Cabaret Law. This law was created in 1926 to prevent interracial dancing and crack down on African American jazz clubs. To this day NYC’s Cabaret Law requires any public venue where people dance to have a special license. Of the thousands of places where New Yorkers dance, 97 have a cabaret license—this is unreasonable. Social dancing is not a crime and should not be treated as such! A bill (Int. No. 1652) to repeal the Cabaret Law was introduced by Council Members Espinal, Reynoso and Levin. Please have my Council Member call me back to let me know how he/she plans to address this issue, which is a major concern to me. I really wish that they will sign on to bill Int. No. 1652. My name is ______, and I live in Council District ______. My phone number is ______."
